print (2+3)         #print the sum of two numbers

print(2/3)          #print the resulting quotient after dividing a number

print (abs(-5.9))   #print the absolute value and ignore the decimal point

print(abs(3-4))     #substract the numbers

print(3>4)          #is 3 greater than 4?

print(range(1,20,5)) #range has start, stop and step parameters, and it is very useful in scipy
#one thing that is being noticed is that the range cannot be printed without iteration, so iteration is necessary

    print(x, end = " ")

print(", the program is over for this but you can try more of the mathematical signs and their operations")
